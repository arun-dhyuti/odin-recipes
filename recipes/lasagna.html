    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>14 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup (140g) chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic, 3 to 4 cloves</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow squash, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>One (12-ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, 1 heaping cup</li>
        <li>1 (28-oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Generous handful fresh basil leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>One (15-oz) container ricotta cheese or cottage cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 ounces (60g) parmesan cheese, grated, about 2/3 cup</li>
        <li>8 ounces (230g) low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded, about 2 cups</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste</li>
   </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, then cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. 
            To prevent the noodles from sticking after they are drained, add two teaspoons of olive oil to the pasta water. 
            Drain, then lay flat on a sheet of aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400°F (204°C). Lightly oil a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish or spray with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>2Heat the olive oil in a wide skillet with sides over medium heat. 
            Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>3Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, zucchini, yellow squash, and a pinch of salt. 
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until the veggies are softened but still have some crunch, another 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>4Stir in the roasted red peppers and crushed tomatoes. Bring to a low simmer and cook until the liquid has thickened and reduced by half, 5 to 8 minutes. 
            Add the basil and season to taste with additional salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>While the sauce cooks, stir together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Toss the parmesan cheese with the mozzarella. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1 cup of your vegetable mixture into the baking dish to lightly cover the bottom. 
            Arrange four noodles lengthwise, side-by-side, to cover the base. Cut a piece to fit if a noodle doesn’t reach the end.
        <li>Spread half of your ricotta mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with a third of your parmesan and mozzarella. Top this with a third of the remaining vegetable sauce.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of four noodles. Spread the rest of your ricotta mixture and half of the remaining parmesan and mozzarella. 
            Top this with half of your remaining vegetable sauce.</li>
        <li>Add a final layer of noodles and the rest of your vegetable sauce. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Then, uncover it and bake for another 15 minutes until the cheese is crusty around the edges.</li>
        <li>For a golden-brown cheesy top, broiler for 1 to 2 minutes. Let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
