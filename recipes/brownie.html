     <h3>Chocolate Brownie</h3>
     <p>Gooey, fudgy, decadent brownies with a shiny, crackly top!</p>

     <h3>Ingredients</h3>

     <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter (226g)</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar (400g)</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder (75g)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (120g)</li>
        <li>1½ cups semisweet chocolate chips (270g)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8×8-inch baking pan with baking spray and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter in the microwave in 20-second intervals stirring between each one until fully melted, about 2 minutes. 
            Add the sugar and cocoa and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. Whisk in the eggs, vanilla, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and chocolate chips and mix together with a spatula until just combined. Spread the batter into the prepared pan. 
            (You can sprinkle the top with more chocolate chips, if desired.)</li>
        <li>Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes, inserting a toothpick into the center to check doneness, and removing it with several moist crumbs for fudgy brownies or only a few crumbs for cakey brownies.
             Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before slicing.</li>
   </ol>
